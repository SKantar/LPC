# LPC
Linear predictive coding (LPC) is a tool used mostly in audio signal processing and speech processing for representing the spectral envelope of a digital signal of speech in compressed form, using the information of a linear predictive model.[1] It is one of the most powerful speech analysis techniques, and one of the most useful methods for encoding good quality speech at a low bit rate and provides extremely accurate estimates of speech parameters.

Tool for LPC Calibration depending on:
* Width of LPC window
* Width of LPC feature vector

## Tools
* Programming Language C (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
* Code::Blocks IDE (http://www.codeblocks.org/)

## Steps 
* Recorder 20 wav files (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV)
  * simular words spoken by femail and mail user
* Displayed euclidian distance for vectors maked with diferent arguments (same words)
